Improvements
- Make the price slider less sensitive.
- Add the possibilty to type in the price.
- Make editing Groceries more intuitive.
- Make the layout more intuitive by allowing creating own named layouts.
- Some way to add extra items in shopping (shampoo, deodorant, etc..)
- Make the tabs load more smoothly, maybe an animation for that?

BUGS
- Adding new groceries to an existing meal does not add them to the shopping list
 if the meal has already been selected.
- Tabbing out while in MealModify and then tabbing back in does the slide animation.
